# Custom Roslyn Rule Example

To add custom Roslyn rules to the tool, check out the [Creating Custom Plugins and Rules wiki page](https://github.com/CodeAnalyzerIS/code-analyzer-tool/wiki/Creating-Custom-Plugins-and-Rules) for an example rule that can be integrated with the built-in Roslyn Plugin. This repository demonstrates how to create a custom rule using the Roslyn analyzer framework and integrate it into the Code Analyzer Tool.
